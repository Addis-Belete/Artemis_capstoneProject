# Tender App
My project was focused on creating a decentralized tender platform by using blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. This platform helps any organization or company post their tender on the blockchain. Any bidder that fulfills the requirement of the organization can bid for a particular tender. The tender owner has the ability to approve or decline the bid based on the proposal bidders submit while bidding. This proposal doesnâ€™t include the price they offer for the tender. They provide proof that they already offered a price for the tender using ZK proofs. Once the bid period ends the bidder can verify their proof and make public the price they offered. After verifying period ends the owner of the tender will announce the winner and the tender will close. The winner will be the one whose proposal was approved and offers a small price.
